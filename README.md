# Cliplab

A character studio for procedural SVG avatars: build a body, layer the eyes,
sequence animations, and export a lightweight embeddable clip. No animation
library.

> **A fork of [bloub](https://github.com/jeremy-prt/bloub) by Jérémy Perret**,
> MIT-licensed and gratefully reused. bloub is an SVG recreation of the x.ai bot
> avatar, measured frame by frame off a reference video.
>
> **Cliplab is mid-migration away from that heritage.** The engine, the
> timeline and the eye model are bloub's and are being kept. The *character* work
> is being replaced: a new analytic shape library, layered eyes, and our own cast.
>
> ⚠️ **Until that replacement lands, this repo still ships bloub's measured
> silhouettes** (`src/bot/profiles.ts`) and the 14 states derived from them. Those
> reproduce the x.ai design and must be replaced before any commercial use — MIT
> covers Jérémy's code, not the design it reproduces. See the project plan.

## Running it

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5190.

```bash
pnpm test     # vitest
pnpm build    # vue-tsc --noEmit && vite build
```

Vue 3, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind 4. No ESLint and no Prettier: `vue-tsc` is the
only gate, so run `pnpm build` before you call something done.

## What's in it

The rail on the left switches between three views. **Customise** offers 2 body
shapes, 3 eye styles, 12 colours and 16 rest expressions, kept between visits. **Animations** is
a small editor: arrange states into a timeline, set how long each is held, save the
result. **Settings** holds the language (French, English or Chinese) and the
credits.

Anything on screen can be exported: the avatar as SVG, PNG or an animated GIF, and
a whole timeline as GIF or MP4. The still formats need no library at all, and the
video encoder is only fetched the first time you ask for one.

Two URLs are worth knowing:

- `#planche`: the 14 states side by side, frozen. Quick visual check.
- `#etat=orbit&stop`: opens one state directly, playback paused.

## Why the numbers look arbitrary

They're measured, not chosen. The reference video was cut at 10 fps and each
state measured off the frames: silhouettes by sub-pixel ray casting, eyes by
capsule fitting, colours and stroke widths by direct sampling.

So the constants in the code are **measurements**, and rounding them to friendlier
values breaks the resemblance, which is the only thing this project is trying to
get right. A few are counter-intuitive enough to be worth knowing before you
correct anything:

| What you'd assume | What the video shows |
|---|---|
| The eyes lean `//` | They lean `\\`, around 26° off vertical |
| The body is a squircle | It's a perfect circle, radial deviation under 0.7% |
| Transitions are springs | Exponential ease-outs; the body never overshoots |
| The comet crosses the screen | The dot stays put, the trail orbits it |
| The avatar floats at rest | It doesn't. The life is gaze drift and blinking |

[docs/measurements.md](docs/measurements.md) has the rest, including how to
regenerate the extracted profiles.

## How it's put together

`src/bot/` is framework-free and clock-free: `engine.sample(t)` is a pure
function of time. Pausing, resuming, jumping to an arbitrary date and running
tests all produce the same image, which is what makes the frozen state board and
the DOM-less test suite possible.

## Using the component

```vue
<BloubBot v-model:block="block" v-model:state="state" v-model:playing="playing" />
<BloubBot state="orbit" :size="120" :frozen-at="1.2" />
```

`block` is the playback cursor: a montage can play the same state twice, so the
index is what identifies where you are; `state` follows it as an output. Pass
`frozenAt` and the component renders one exact frame with no animation loop, which
is how the thumbnails and the state board are drawn.

Props: `size`, `shape`, `color`, `expression`, `paper`, `frozenAt`, `cycle`,
`follow`, `gaze`. Models: `block`, `state`, `playing`, `elapsed`. See
[BloubBot.vue](src/components/BloubBot.vue) for the details.
